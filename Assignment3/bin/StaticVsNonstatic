Static and Non-Static are Keywords in java.
When a Java application is executed, JVM will load all the members of the class which have the keyword "Static"
i.e, who are static.
Non-Static members will be there inside the hard disk only.
Java is highly dynamic, which means that it will load only the required 
part of the application into the RAM (only static members).

Both methods and variables can be static or non-static.
but the main method needs to be static only as it is the entry point of
the application.


static int i=10; //This is a static variable of int type

int i=10; //This is a non-static variable of int type
