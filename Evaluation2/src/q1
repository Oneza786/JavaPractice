ACCESS MODIFIERS- 
In Java, there are 4 types of access modifiers -
1. Public
2. Private
3. Protected
4. Default

1.Public- Visibility of public member is everywhere. It can be accessed
          outside the class and even outside the package.
2. Private - Visibility of a private member is only inside the class it is
           defined.
3. Protected - Protected members can be accessed through the child class
            outside the package and easily within the package.
4. Default - Visibility of a default member is only within the package.
             If you don't any other access modifier before a member then
             it is a default member, we don't need to explicitly write 
             the default keyword.
